# Otium

**A nervous-system-aware focus and recovery system.**

Otium helps you notice when your phone has become a coping mechanism instead of a tool. It doesn't block apps, track productivity, or reward streaks. It simply notices cognitive fragmentation patterns and offers a moment to breathe.

---

## 🧠 The Problem

Modern smartphone usage creates a specific type of stress:

| Behavior | What's Actually Happening |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Rapid tapping | Agitation signal — nervous system is dysregulated |
| Doom-scrolling | Seeking dopamine hits — avoiding present-moment discomfort |
| Rapid app switching | Cognitive fragmentation — brain can't sustain attention |
| Compulsive checking | Phone as anxiety coping mechanism, not tool |

**Traditional solutions fail because:**
- **App blockers** are punitive — they don't address *why* you're reaching for your phone
- **Screen time trackers** create shame without offering regulation
- **Productivity apps** with streaks/badges train more dopamine-seeking behavior
- **Willpower-based approaches** deplete an already exhausted nervous system

### Otium's Approach

Otium treats cognitive overload as a **biological signal, not a moral failing**. When it detects fragmentation patterns, it doesn't block or shame — it offers a 60-second breathing exercise that activates the brain's Default Mode Network (DMN), enabling genuine recovery.

## ✨ Features

### 1. Focus Sprints (Ultradian Rhythm Alignment)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Configurable Duration** | 45, 60, or 90-minute sessions based on cognitive mode |
| **Minimal UI** | Just a timer — zero cognitive load from interface chrome |
| **State Persistence** | Sprint survives app restarts, phone reboots |
| **Pause/Resume** | Can leave and return without losing progress |
| **Live Friction Counter** | Shows current interaction score vs. threshold |

### 2. Pattern Sensing (Fragmentation Detection)

| Signal Detected | Weight | Why It Matters |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| Normal tap | 1 | Baseline interaction |
| Rapid tap (<500ms) | 2 | Agitation indicator |
| Scroll gesture | 1-5 | Duration-based (doom-scrolling detection) |
| App switch | 3 | Context break |
| Rapid app switch (<10s) | 5 | Severe cognitive fragmentation |

**Algorithm:**
- Uses a **60-second rolling window**
- Events older than 60 seconds are automatically pruned
- When weighted sum exceeds profile threshold → intervention triggers

### 3. Breathing Intervention

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **4-4-4 Pattern** | Inhale (4s) → Hold (4s) → Exhale (4s) → Hold (4s) |
| **60-Second Duration** | Minimum effective dose for DMN activation |
| **Cannot Skip** | Prevents impulsive dismissal |
| **Visual Guidance** | Animated breathing circle with phase indicators |
| **Persistence** | If interrupted, resumes where it left off |

### 4. Cognitive Mode Selection

Before each sprint, users select their current activity type:

| Mode | Threshold | Sprint | Use Case |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Learning** | 30 | 60 min | Reading, studying, absorbing new info |
| **Deep Work** | 40 | 90 min | Writing, coding, analysis |
| **Creating** | 50 | 90 min | Design, art, building — needs flow protection |
| **Already Scattered** | 25 | 45 min | Starting depleted — gentler thresholds |

### 5. Recovery Periods

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **15-Minute Timer** | Follows each sprint |
| **Analog Nudges** | "Step away", "Hydrate", "Light movement" |
| **Voluntary Exit** | Can end early — respects user autonomy |
| **Ambient Animation** | Calming wave patterns |

### 6. System Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Overlay Intervention** | Can appear over other apps (Android) |
| **Offline-First** | All data stored locally via SharedPreferences |
| **No Cloud/No Login** | Zero data leaves device |
| **App Lifecycle Handling** | Foreground/background state management |

## 🛡️ Design Philosophy

### The "Seatbelt, Not Steering Wheel" Principle

You don't constantly interact with a seatbelt — you only notice it when it protects you. Otium works the same way:
- Invisible during normal use
- Activates only when fragmentation is detected
- Gentle intervention, not aggressive blocking

### Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Autonomy** | User can exit recovery early |
| **Transparency** | All heuristics are visible and explainable |
| **Biological Alignment** | Respects ultradian rhythms and DMN activation |
| **Dignity** | No shame, no scores, no comparison |
| **Privacy** | All data stays on device |

### What Otium Will NEVER Include

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Streaks/Badges | Trains dopamine-seeking behavior |
| Productivity Scores | Reduces humans to metrics |
| Social Comparison | Induces performance anxiety |
| Cloud Sync | Enables surveillance |
| AI Insights | Offloads thinking to machines |
| App Blocking | Punitive, doesn't address root cause |
| Notification Nudges | Becomes another interruption |

## 📊 The Science Behind Otium

### Ultradian Rhythms

Humans have natural 90-minute focus cycles. Working against these cycles leads to:
- Cognitive depletion
- Compensatory phone use
- Fragmentation spirals

Otium aligns sprint duration with these natural cycles.

### Default Mode Network (DMN)

The brain's DMN activates during:
- Rest and reflection
- Mind-wandering
- Emotional processing

Constant stimulation (scrolling) prevents DMN activation. The 60-second breathing intervention creates a minimum viable DMN rest period.

### Nervous System Regulation

The 4-4-4 breathing pattern activates the parasympathetic nervous system:
- Slows heart rate
- Reduces cortisol
- Creates felt-sense of safety

This addresses the *root cause* of compulsive phone use: nervous system dysregulation.
